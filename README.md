## _Django Project for Printing DB_
## How it works

1. Get the object from the DB (In this project I created a student name "Kevin" using django default admin panel and used those details)
2. Then display it in html format
3. Then it uses printJS library for printing it

## Tech

This project uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- Django - Used for Server Side
- JavaScript - Used for printing the generated HTML page using Browser print function
## Installation

This project requires Python3 and Django library

Install the dependencies and start the server.

```sh
pip install django
```
